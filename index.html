					<h1>Introduction</h1>
					<p>Hi! Welcome to my personal website! I'm Marisa. I'm a queer and trans woman, my pronouns are she, her and hers, and my title is Miss (as in, Miss Marisa Marion Mackenzie).</p>
					<p>My title is Miss for a few reasons: one reason being I like it better than "Ms."; and another is I like to think of it as short for Mistress, and I find that empowering.</p>
					<p>My personal hobbies and interests include but are far from limited to: computers and technology, programming, data archival and preservation, art, graphic design, creative story and poetry writing, reading (especially what I refer to as science fiction-comedy stories), video games and their game engines and internals, computer restoration and refurbishing, community building, and so much more.</p>
					<p>My favorite colors are: pink, purple, yellow, and teal.</p>
					<p>My favorite place in the whole wide world is a park and beach located in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada called "Rogers Cove".</p>

					<h1>Inactive Project Ideas</h1>
					<p>I have had plenty of project ideas over the years that have largely stayed just that: ideas. I often jokingly refer to them as vaporware, because they'll probably never be done.</p>
					<p>But still, these ideas are important to me and deeply interest me, and I'd like to use this space to share them.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>"Rainbow Game Engine" & "Mathilda Scripting Language": a fully-customizable 3D first-person game engine and an associated scripting language with as little limitations as possible. One idea I envisioned was providing internet access in Mathilda paired with in-game texture-setting functionality to e.g. allow a game to set wall-textures with images downloaded from the internet. I envisioned having an in-game art gallery level that can automatically change art exhibits every month, for example.</li>
						<li>"Derelict Division in: Space, Time and Pizza": a queer futuristic science-fiction-comedy 'slice of life' story book that follows a group of queer and gender-diverse people through time and space as they go about their lives.</li>
						<li>A data archival and preservation project that operates entirely without outside interference (as in, the complete inability to take the project or its contents down, or restrict access in any way).</li>
						<li>A computer and technology restoration and refurbishing project to provide free computers and technology to those otherwise unable to access it and to help divert electronics that are salvageable away from going to waste.</li>
						<li>"Marisa's Fine Artist": a business where I sell my art, including custom pin buttons.</li>
					</ul>

					<h1>Active Projects</h1>
					<p>While I have lots of inactive "vaporware" projects, there are a numbers of things I do actively work on, and I'd like to share them here as well! These projects are important to me, too.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Queer-Faciliated Poetry Group: I volunteer to co-faciliate a drop-in poetry group for community members, especially those who are marginalized, to create and share poetry together.</li>
						<li>I volunteer to co-faciliate a penpal project to write and receive letters back-and-forth between people who are incarcerated and people who are not.</li>
					</ul>
